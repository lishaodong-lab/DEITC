Guangyu Xiang, Shaodong Li*, Guangxi University, Nanning, China (Code is coming soon)
# Introduction
In this work, we were interested in investigating the efficacy of SC-AIRL on long-horizon tasks. SC-AIRL is a form of Inverse Reinforcement Learning (IRL) that decomposes long-horizon tasks into multiple sub-tasks, where a discriminator, acting as a reward signal, and sub-policies are simultaneously learned using expert data. Empirically, we found that this state-of-the-art IRL-based method is unable to effectively solve longer-horizon manipulation tasks. We demonstrated that this is because SC-AIRL is susceptible to state shifts, where starting the next sub-task from an unsuitable state can lead to failure. Below, we show the connection process of SC-AIRL and a simplified example where this occursï¼š

# Experiments Setup
We test our method in three long-horizon tasks with main baselines(SC-AIRL/T-STAR):

# Ablation Study:
In this section, we further explore the impact of design variations in DEITC: 1) ablation study on the rewards for the chaining policy; 2) ablation study on fine-tuning the sub-policies and the automatic selection of terminal states.<br>
The main Results:<br>

# Empirical analysis:
Three-dimensional coordinates of the positions where the robot end-effector grasps the red block (i.e. terminal states) in the Stack Three task. <br> 
Left: The policy learned by DEITC selects terminal states for completing the current subtask that show a higher degree of overlap with the terminal states in expert demonstrations. <br> 
Right: In SC-AIRL, using the Goal set to select the terminal states leads to significant deviation from expert demonstrations, potentially causing failure in subtask connections. <br>

# Real experiments:
We train the policies on Pybullet and deploy the trajectories generated by the learned policies onto a UR10 robot in the real-world Stack Three task. <br>
